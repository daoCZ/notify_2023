SCRUM Meeting 1 for Notify
Meeting Date: 04/22/2022
Minutes from 04/22/2022

More local testing has been done with Oauth 2.0 and we successfully have tried it with different 
users. We have made the choice to switch from Instagram to the Facebook API because it is slightly 
easier to authenticate a login. However it does prove more restrictive as you can not load your 
live feed in and only have access to your personal account. The front end has been redone to make 
it more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. The twitter Feed has been tested to correctly 
receive the API requests sent from the login page.

SCRUM Meeting 2 for Notify
Meeting Date: 04/27/2022
Minutes from 04/27/2022

For front-end development, Anas focused on creating links for login pages like Facebook and 
Twitter, and formatting all the images into an aesthetically pleasing style, while helping 
implement back-end code into Heroku and remote hosting, however YouTube ran into some difficulties.
Facebook is going well, where posts are being outputted to the feed, but not completely formatted.
We stopped using the Twitter login as it was not necessary and reformatted some code.  The search
bar for both YouTube and Twitter were formatted and improved functionally where there are no 
conflicts between searching for both YouTube and Twitter users.

SCRUM Meeting 3 for Notify
Meeting Date: 5/02/2022
Minutes from 5/02/2022

For back-end development, Matthew worked on Facebook development for the feed box, displaying 
posts, the username, and the picture of the profile, and formatting the output. For twitter, 
Anthony started outputting the timeline into the notification feed while not using OAuth Twitter 
login as it is not needed for data collection and parsing. Brian and Matthew worked on YouTube 
OAuth and remote hosting to Heroku simultaneously. Anas continued to work on the aesthetics of the
 website and also finalizing accessibility features for the website. For the last meeting, the 
back-end goal is to have a functional notification feed that is formatted correctly, while the 
front-end focuses on implementing outputs into an aesthetically pleasing style.
