270,anonpost1997,@hodlvolk @zetrosoft @majesticprimate @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT @goodgc81 That really only applies to a select group of people who are basically WASPs now after interbreeding. The Mexicans jumping over the border right now and in past years have no claim to it. Everyone in that group is WASP now basically.
271,hodlvolk,@zetrosoft @anonpost1997 @majesticprimate @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT @goodgc81 Doesn't sound like my word choice....
272,zetrosoft,@anonpost1997 @majesticprimate @hodlvolk @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT Brahmins run judiciary and bureaucracy in India
273,anonpost1997,"@majesticprimate @zetrosoft @hodlvolk @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT Also, Kammas run immigration scam here. Brahmins on other hand are too weak, divided, and moral to do that kind of stuff. We get blamed for everything."
274,anonpost1997,"@majesticprimate @zetrosoft @hodlvolk @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT Yes, it‚Äôs an important one to get particularly because the Brahmins are ineffective and monopolizing institutions due to diversity and morals. Baniyas on the other hand took over Uganda till Idi Amin kicked them out and Patel have taken over hotel industry here. (1/2)"
275,hodlvolk,"@zetrosoft @anonpost1997 @majesticprimate @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT @goodgc81 I said that after the Mexican American War there were Mexicans living in Texas and California who were given the option to go to Mexico or stay in the US, and many stayed. Because you were trying to claim it was an wasp ethno state."
276,zetrosoft,"@anonpost1997 @hodlvolk @majesticprimate @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT @goodgc81 You can search ""Hindus America elite"" if you're on the old group.

USB thing was also brought up by him"
277,majesticprimate,"@anonpost1997 @zetrosoft @hodlvolk @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT @goodgc81 Gotta stop lashing out @zetrosoft, it's not going to get you anywhere."
278,anonpost1997,@zetrosoft @hodlvolk @majesticprimate @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT @goodgc81 He‚Äôs clearly being facetious
279,majesticprimate,"@anonpost1997 @zetrosoft @hodlvolk @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT @anonpost1997 I learned this from Jayant, by the way. Can't recall the exact comment. But I'd inherited this Western simple notion of caste as just pure hierarchy so brahmins must be driving all of this &amp; exporting it. &amp;As he does he just politely &amp; bluntly cleared that right up."

288,zetrosoft,@hodlvolk @majesticprimate @anonpost1997 @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT That's so ironic coming from you. 2 weeks ago you were saying Hindus should be the elite in America
289,hodlvolk,@zetrosoft @majesticprimate @anonpost1997 @valleyridersss @veritasium @CityBeautifulYT I don't trust you to wake up to tomorrow and hold the same opinion have right now. God knows what you'll belive 5 minutes from now.

But yes young adults who're already culturally ingrained yet have accomplished nothing. These are the last people who should try to be adopted elsewhere.

They should attempt something at home, even failing. &amp; Then see if they've proven their value as an adoptee elsewhere."
